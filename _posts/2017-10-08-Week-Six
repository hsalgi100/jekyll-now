### What did you do this past week?

I took two out of four midterms and worked a bit more on voting. I know exactly what I need to do now, I just need to figure out how to translate it correctly into code. The group I am observing for the website also got back some criticism for the first phase which they are working on fixing, and they will be starting the next phase as well. Other than that I went to my TA's office hours and learned a little bit about Closures. I remembered that it was mentioned offhandedly in class once and I did not really understand what they were, but now I have a bit of a better idea. 

### What's in your way?

A lot of the time I have to put this class off so I don't get too behind in my other classes. I am working on getting better at time management, but unfortunately I was not able to devote much time to my side assignment this week. If I was actually enrolled in this class, I would never take it with fifteen other hours. It requires a good bit of time since I have actually decided to try and do side projects to apply what I am learning, and more so if I was to be building the website.

### What will you do next week?

I will take my remaining two midterms, which both happen to be on Monday so that is a bit unfortunate. After that I will have much more time to actually start devoting myself to Python more again. I will also meet up with the group I am observing if they have any meetings this week about the website before they have to take the midterm. I am most likely going to study with them for it, if they decide to meet up as a group to do that, because it is a good excuse to review everything we have studied thus far to reaffirm my knowledge, and to see whether or not I have forgotten or misunderstood anything. 

### What's my experience of the class?

It's a good class, and I liked being able to go to office hours and ask about the thing I am doing and not have to have it be about the website. It is a bit unlucky for me though because the professor's office hours are usually during my other classes so I can only really go if he has an extension, and if that extension works with my schedule. I make up for it by going to the TA office hours and lab sessions when I can, and that has worked pretty well for me so far. 

### What's my tip-of-the-week or pick-of-the-week?

I don't really have a tip-of-the-week this week. I learned about the existence of LeetCode while asking a friend of mine about advice for future interview prep. Most people should already know of it's existence, but it looked like a pretty helpful thing to use. There's also this book called "Cracking the Coding Interview" which looks like it could be useful too.
