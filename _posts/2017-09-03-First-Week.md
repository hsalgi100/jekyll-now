title: CS373 Fall 2017: Helen Salgi
---

This blog will be centered around things I learn from and for CS373. It is my very first programming course at the university and I hope to get a lot out of it.

### What are your expectations of the class?

I've dabbled in a few programming languages in the past, namely Java, Python, and Haskell. I've also read through the syntax of many, many more. The main thing I want to get out of this class is confidence and a bit more mental fortitude. Of course, I want to get better at Python and learn how to be a good programmer in regards to working at a company, but what I really want is to be able to sit in front of a computer with no idea of how to do something and to not freak out about it. I want to use this class as a stepping stone in building the skills I need to become a better programmer in general. I want practice and tools. Basically, I expect this class to boost my googling skills and teach me helpful things. I also generally want to use this class to get more comfortable using github and linux. Knowing how to build a website also seems pretty useful all around.

### What did you do this past week?

Reading. I did a LOT of reading. This week was the first week of school, and this semester my teachers absolutely love books. Granted, everything I read was quite interesting so it wasn't that bad. In this class I read about how to be an extreme progammer, and it was really interesting. I like how it's a textbook that gives strategies for how to work with people. It's an easy read, and useful for understanding and learning a good dynamic in the workplace. I also read the supplementa documents, and the one titled "Little Bug, Big Bang" really struck me. It was hilarious, but also a little bit terrifying. I really feel bad for whoever made the mistake that caused that, whether it be one person or more than one. I wonder how fast they got fired. Aside from that, I had a little epiphany. Maybe languages like rust and kitten have ints with specified sizes now (like 32bit and 64bit) so that something like that doesn't happen again. I always thought they were just being annoyingly specific until now.

The rest of what I did this week had absolutely nothing to do with computer science. Though I am happy to say that I am now about halfway done with season 4 of Game of Thrones, so that is progressing nicely. 

### What's in your way?

As I said earlier, this is my very first computer science class at UT. I have next to nothing when it comes to programming experience. Though I am only an observer, I do want to make the most out of this class. I am a bit worried that it will be hard to keep up with everything. Not to mention, adding this class I am taking a total of 18 hours, so I am a little bit worried about the amount of work and stress. I will not be doing the same projects that the professor assigns in class to everyone else, but I already have a plan for doing other projects that will test my knowledge of the material. The biggest things in my way right now are time management and comprehension. So far the professor has gone at a very good pace and I have been able to understand everything. I am also up to date on all of my work. I hope it will continue to be like this. 

### What will you do next week?

Next week I will start on the first project that I have set to do for this class. I will also continue will the next 300 pages I have to read for assorted classes.
