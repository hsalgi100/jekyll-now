title: CS373 Fall 2017: Helen Salgi
---

This blog will be centered around things I learn from and for CS373. It is my very first programming course at the university and I hope to get a lot out of it.

### What are your expectations of the class?

I've dabbled in a few programming languages in the past, namely Java, Python, and Haskell. I've also read through the syntax of many, many more. The main thing I want to get out of this class is confidence and a bit more mental fortitude. Of course, I want to get better at Python and learn how to be a good programmer in regards to working at a company, but what I really want is to be able to sit in front of a computer with no idea of how to do something and to not freak out about it. I want to use this class as a stepping stone in building the skills I need to become a better programmer in general. I want practice and tools. Basically, I expect this class to boost my googling skills and teach me helpful things.
