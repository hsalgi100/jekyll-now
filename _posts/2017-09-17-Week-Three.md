### What did you do this past week?

I worked on Collatz and learned about some cool stuff Python has. I also finished reading a book called Minaret about a girl who fled Sudan during the political turmoil in the 80's and her late teenage years/adult life in London after that. Then once the weekend hit I finished season 6 of Game of Thrones. It's getting pretty intense. I also read about this cool language called Tree on wikipedia. It basically has branches, leaves, and insects and each of those things represents something in the code. Also, each program has to start with one vertical branch. Then my friend showed me a language called Piet that basically shows a bunch of colors. It was really pretty and really cool. 
On Thursday I went to career fair and got an insane amount of free stuff. I also got some good advice and information from a guy at Microsoft. As I've said, I don't really have any coding experience so he gave me some tips and told me about some programs and classes I should take.

### What's in your way?

I'm turning in Collatz really late because I just don't know how to pass the third test on hackerrank. Well I have an idea for it, but I don't really know how to write it. I was also having trouble just getting past the second test, but I managed to pass that one yesterday. I honestly don't really mind about my grade for it (mostly since it won't count for me), I'm just really annoyed with this and I am determined to finish this project. Ideally, the rest of the stuff I do for this class, I will do on time with the deadlines given to me. 

### What will you do next week?

Turn in Collatz. I'll also start working on anything new that is given to us, and the other homework for my other classes because I can't exactly forget about those. I also want to start season 7 of Game of Thrones. It sounds like I constantly waste my time watching this, but I don't actually do it that often. Plus Game of Thrones is amazing. 

### What's my experience of the class?

It's a bit hard when things turn up on quizzes that are supposed to have partial prior knowledge that I do not have, but then when the professor explains the wuestion right after I understand it a lot better. I always write down all the quiz questions to learn better and remember better. The class itself is still okay to keep up with. Some parts of the last lecture on Friday were a bit confusing, but then I went to office hours and now it's much clearer to me. The project is hard because optimization is hard. The simple solution took no time at all. Other than that, I like the class and I've been learning a lot from it. 

### What's my tip-of-the-week or pick-of-the-week?

If anyone ever wants to learn Lisp, they should read the Little Schemer. It's a really good book and it explains everything very simply. There are a lot of examples and practice problems inside. The way the author walks you through it, even someone who has never programmed in their life could figure it out. Even if a person just reads the first 3 or 5 chapters or so, they will get a lot out of it.
